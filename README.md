#### Apprise persistence and credentials

Apprise uses `/config` for its persistent API configuration. Deployments can
opt into a PVC with `services.apprise.persistence.use` and
`services.apprise.persistence.claimName`; otherwise the legacy `config`
hostPath is used. An existing deployment-owned Secret can be mounted read-only
with `services.apprise.existingSecret`. The chart neither creates that Secret
nor interprets its contents, so credentials remain outside chart values and
logs. `attachSize` defaults to `0`; a deployment enabling attachments must
provide an appropriate writable attachment volume separately.
### Automation

- 🔄 [`changedetection.io`](https://changedetection.io): Monitor web pages for changes.
### Development
- 🎭 [`playwright`](https://playwright.dev/): A headless browser automator.

## Dedicated persistence

Define opt-in PVCs in `common.storage.persistentVolumes`; enable a service with
`services.<name>.persistence.use: true`. Each PVC can define `migration` with
source paths; the chart creates one copy Job per enabled migration. Existing
services keep using `longhorn-volv-pvc` until switched.

## CLI
